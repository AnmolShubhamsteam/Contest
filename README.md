# Assignment

The main goal of this assignment is to familiarize students with version control using Git while reinforcing their understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Students will be provided with a set of algorithmic challenges to solve, and they are required to use Git for version control during the development process.

## Step 1 - Open the repo link

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnmolShubhamsteam/Contest.git
```
### Step 2 - Deleting the .git file 
```bash
Open the directory where you cloned the repository.

Ensure that hidden files are visible in your file explorer:

Windows:

Click on the "View" tab at the top.
Check the "Hidden items" checkbox in the "Show/hide" group.

macOS:
Open Finder.
Press Command + Shift + Dot (.) to toggle the visibility of hidden files.

Linux:
Press Ctrl + H to toggle the visibility of hidden files in most file managers.
Navigate to the "contest" folder within the cloned repository.

Delete the .git files.
``` 
### Step 3 - Solve the problems
```
Solve the questions either using c++ or python. 
If all test cases pass, we can then save the respective files
(.cpp for C++ or .py for Python).
```
### Step 4 - use git Command
```bash
git init 
git add .
git commit -m "Solved"
```
### Step 5 - Create a github account
```bash 
Visit the GitHub Website:
Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub website: GitHub.

Sign Up:

On the GitHub homepage, click on the "Sign up" button.
Provide Account Information:

Fill out the required information in the sign-up form, including a unique username, a valid email address, and a strong password.
Complete the CAPTCHA:

Complete any CAPTCHA verification process if prompted.
Choose a Plan:

Select a plan based on your needs. GitHub offers both free and paid plans, depending on your requirements.
Verify Your Email:

GitHub will send a verification email to the address you provided. Open the email and click on the verification link to confirm your account.
Set Up Your Profile:

Once your account is verified, you can set up your profile by adding a profile picture and some information about yourself if you wish.
Explore GitHub:

You can now explore GitHub, join repositories, contribute to projects, and create your own repositories.
```

### Step 6 - Create a repository
```bash
Log in to Your GitHub Account:

Open your web browser and go to GitHub.
Log in to your GitHub account if you are not already logged in.
Navigate to Your Dashboard:

Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage to open a dropdown menu.
Select "New Repository":

In the dropdown menu, click on "New repository."
Fill Out the Repository Information:

Enter a unique and descriptive name for your repository in the "Repository name" field.
Optionally, provide a brief description of your repository in the "Description" field.
Choose the visibility of your repository (Public or Private).
Initialize this repository with a README if you want to create an initial README file.
Configure Repository Options:

You can add a .gitignore file (specifying files to be ignored by Git), choose a license for your project, and add a .gitattributes file if needed.
Create Repository:

Click the "Create repository" button.
Copy the Repository URL:

After creating the repository, you'll be redirected to the repository page. Copy the repository URL if you plan to clone the repository to your local machine.
```
### Step 7 - Push your solved code to your repository
```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin link of your repository
git push -u origin main
